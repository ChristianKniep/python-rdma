=============
 Python RDMA
=============

This package contains the Python module `rdma` which provides access to the
Linux RDMA stack in the Python language. It is an amalgamation of the
functionality contained in the Open Fabrics Alliance packages `libibmad`,
`libibumad`, `libibverbs`, `libibnetdisc` and `infiniband-diags`.

The module is written entirely in Python and only relies on external
system libraries to provide ibverbs functionality.

Prebuilt documentation for the module can be reviewed `online
<http://www.obsidianresearch.com/python-rdma/doc/index.html>`_, and the source
code is available on `GitHub <http://github.com/jgunthorpe/python-rdma>`_.

`python-rdma` is maintained by Obsidian Research Corp. and the main contact
for the package is Jason Gunthorpe <jgunthorpe@obsidianresearch.com>
